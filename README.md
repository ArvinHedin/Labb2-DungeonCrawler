# Dungeon Crawler

#### **This program is a simple console application game made for a school assaingment.**  

The player navigates through the level and encounters different types of enemies. The player can attack the enemies and the attacks and defenses stats that are randomized each time combat is engaged within a certain stat-range.  

The player can move around using *WASD* and can stand still using *SPACEBAR*.  
The player has a vision range which limits how much of the level is visable around the player.
